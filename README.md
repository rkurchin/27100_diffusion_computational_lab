# 27-100 Computational Lab: Diffusion
You can access this activity in the cloud [here](https://chemcompute.org/jupyterhub_internal/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frkurchin%2F27100_diffusion_computational_lab.git&urlpath=tree%2F27100_diffusion_computational_lab.git%2Fdiffusion_computational_lab.ipynb&branch=main). You will need to log in with institutional credentials, then **click/paste the link again** since it will zap you to the homepage after doing that. When you get to the "Server Options" page, be sure to change the radio button for language to "Julia" to get a kernel that can actually run the code!

If Google Colab is more your jam, you can get that using this button:
<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/rkurchin/27100_diffusion_computational_lab/blob/main/colab/diffusion_computational_lab_colab.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

For this to work, you will have to manually change the Colab runtime to Julia (click button that probably says "Python 3" in bottom right of window, and select "Julia" instead).
