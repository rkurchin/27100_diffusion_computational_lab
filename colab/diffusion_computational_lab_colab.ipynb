    "# 27-100 Computational MSE Lab: Diffusion!\n",
    "Welcome to the computational lab! In these exercises, we'll explore diffusion at both the atomistic and continuum lengthscales. As you've seen by now, one of the hallmarks of \"MSE thinking\" is connecting across lengthscales â€“ for example, understanding dislocation motion and how it leads to plastic deformation. We've talked some in lecture about atomistic mechanisms of diffusion (e.g. via vacancies) as well as how we describe it in a continuum setting (Fick's Laws). Here we'll explore how those ideas are connected to each other through a series of **computational experiments** that you'll be guided through. You will not need to write any code yourself (though if you're curious, you'll be able to see the code that's being run).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also be able to see how such **computational experiments** can be very analogous to lab-based ones...keep this in mind as you work, and think about how computation can be similar to/different from experiments, and how the two approaches might complement each other!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this thing I'm reading?\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook, an environment for **literate programming**, where formatted text (like this) can be interspersed with interactively runnable code cells (like the ones immediately below this). Jupyter comes from Ju (Julia) + Py (Python) + R, and as the name suggests, it can run code in all three of these languages. This particular notebook is running Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell, simply select it by clicking on it and use `Shift` + `Enter` to execute the code. You'll need to execute each cell for things to work properly â€“ many of them will create an interactive thing for you to work with, for example to paste data into for processing. You should not need to change any of the code itself directly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and run these first two cells below now â€“ they will set up the computational environment so that all the needed packages will be loaded. When they've executed successfully, a number should appear to the left."

    "# Atomistic-Scale Diffusion: Molecular Dynamics\n",
    "We'll start by investigating diffusion at the atomistic scale, in a way that only simulations are capable of (at least right now)...by tracking positions of thousands of individual atoms at once! This uses a technique called **molecular dynamics**, where we choose a model interatomic potential (in this case, Lennard-Jones, which you explored a bit on homework 5) and just run Newton's Laws between all pairs of particles to generate atomic trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "><b>A note about units:</b>\n",
    ">    \n",
    "> All the quantities we'll work with in this section are in <i>Lennard-Jones units</i>, meaning that we've nondimensionalized according to the LJ parameters $\\sigma$ (a distance) and $\\epsilon$ (an energy), as well as the mass $m$ of the particles we are modeling. For example, time is in units of $\\sqrt{\\frac{m\\sigma^2}{\\epsilon}}$ (you can check for yourself that the dimensions work out here!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a nice online two-dimensional MD engine that you can access [HERE](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/). Start by opening it up and playing around a bit to familiarize yourself with the interface (if you explore any of the Presets, just refresh the page at the end to get to the default setup, which is what we'll be using).\n",
    "\n",
    "In an atomistic simulation like this, we can extract diffusion coefficients by tracking the **mean squared displacement (MSD)** of atoms across the system trajectory, and the diffusion coefficient is related to the slope of MSD vs. time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{MSD} = 2nDt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(where $n$ is the number of dimensions, so for the 2D case we'll be playing with here, $\\mathrm{MSD}=4Dt$)\n",
    "\n",
    "But things down at the atomistic level are _noisy_, so to get good estimates, we need LOTS of data! We'll explore a few different ways to collect a LOT of data here...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: tracking individual atoms\n",
    "One way to collect a LOT of data is to collect the locations of a single particle at many, many time points. Let's try that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to set up our experiment. We want to get our box to contain **2125 atoms and be at a nondimensional temperature of 0.55**. It's not completely trivial to fill up the box that far, and there are a number of different ways to do it. I'll demonstrate one during the lab session, which essentially involves repeatedly \"freezing\" the box, dragging up the number of atoms slider as far as it will go, and repeating. Then at the end, use the \"Faster\" (and/or \"Slower\" and 1% adjustment buttons) to get the temperature to the right level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get to that density and temperature, we need to set things up to be able to collect data. Pause the simulation (top left button) if it's running, and do the following:\n",
    "1. Click the `â†“Dataâ†“` button on the bottom right of the window to expand the data collection pane.\n",
    "2. Change \"Data type\" to \"Selected Atom\" so we can write full trajectories for one atom at a time.\n",
    "3. Change the \"Mouse/touch\" dropdown near the top to \"Select\" and click on an atom near the middle of the box.\n",
    "4. Change the \"Auto interval\" dropdown (near the bottom of the window) to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below highlights elements of the interface you'll need to interact with/pay attention to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/rkurchin/27100_diffusion_computational_lab/misc/md_figure.png?raw=true\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-height:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have everything set up, you're ready to collect data! Click the \"Reset stats\" button, and then \"Resume\" â€“ data should begin writing out in the box automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another note to speed things up, your computer should easily be able to handle running multiple of these at once. Go ahead and feel free to set things up in multiple browser windows (if you use tabs, it will pause or slow the simulation substantially when that tab is not in focus) to collect data simulataneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect ten trajectories of a duration of at least 3000 time units and enter them in the boxes that appear when you evaluate the cells below. A few notes:\n",
    "* It's a good idea to select a different atom each time\n",
    "* Keep an eye on the temperature! It will drift up over time and you should adjust downwards between data collection runs if necessary (don't do it during data collection!)\n",
    "* It's easiest to keep track of things if you \"Reset stats\" between each run, but if you forget, just make sure your total duration (final timestamp minus initial) is at least 3000; the data processing code below will handle things just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>ðŸš¨ Preserving data ðŸš¨</b>\n",
    ">     \n",
    "> I strongly suggest also pasting your data into a local document on your machine. If you accidentally leave or refresh this page, you will lose data you have already entered!\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste in your first trajectory below â€“ this should be the FULL contents of the box with the data in it, including the headers! Make sure that the quotation marks don't get replaced, so your data should end up between them, replacing ONLY the text itself. After you paste the data, evaluate the cell as you did above.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: the data will be a very large block of text that might make scrolling in the notebook annoying; you can click the little blue bar to the left of the cell while your cursor is in it to collapse the display down to a manageable size. I found it easier to do this to all the cells after evaluating all of them."
